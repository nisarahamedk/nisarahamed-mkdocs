Topic: How to effectively adopt AI Coding Assistants at your org

1. There are lot of coding assistants out there. Copilot, Cursor, Windsurf etc.

2. Org need a clear evaluation framework to make sure they stay on top of the new AI coding tools.

3. Org also needs a structured adoption metrics like in the DX platform to measure the ROI

4. I suggest implementing an Internal SWE Bench to evaluate any AI coding tools with org specific tasks.
